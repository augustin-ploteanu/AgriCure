        'disease': 'Infected',
        'causes': 'Cucumber plants are susceptible to various diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, and environmental factors. These diseases often arise due to poor cultural practices, such as overcrowding, inadequate drainage, and the presence of infected debris. Additionally, diseases can spread through contaminated seeds, water, and equipment, making sanitation and management practices essential for prevention.',
        'treatment': 'To manage cucumber diseases effectively, start by using pathogen-free seeds and selecting resistant varieties when available. Implement good sanitation practices by removing infected plant material and debris, and rotate crops to minimize pathogen buildup in the soil. Ensure proper irrigation management to avoid excessive moisture, and monitor plants regularly for early symptoms. If disease signs appear, initiate a fungicide or bactericide application based on the specific conditions and pathogen involved, while also considering integrated pest management strategies to control insect vectors.',
