        'disease': 'Blotch',
        'causes': 'Apple blotch fungus is a common, mostly cosmetic disease affecting apple skin, causing irregular, olive-green spots. It is generally safe to eat unless the person is allergic to mold, with treatment varying depending on the severity of the problem.',
        'treatment': 'If the blotch is minimal, apples can be eaten after rubbing the skin or removing it for baking or juicing. Gardeners can manage apple blotch by pruning trees to reduce humidity, removing nearby bramble patches, and thinning fruits to prevent fungal transmission. For more serious cases, fungicide sprays can be applied after apple flowers fall, with regular applications throughout the growing season using effective fungicides like thiophanate-methyl, kresoxim methyl, or trifloxystrobin.',

        'disease': 'Rot',
        'causes': 'Rot occurs due to excess moisture or fungal infections, affecting apples and causing them to decay. Poor air circulation can contribute to the problem.',
        'treatment': 'To manage black rot, practice good sanitation by pruning dead or diseased branches, removing shriveled fruit, and discarding infected plant material through burning, burying, or composting. Prune trees in late winter, and ensure proper tree care by planting hardy cultivars in suitable locations, providing adequate water, and managing fire blight. Fungicide sprays are generally not necessary, but products like Captan or sulfur may help if cultural practices alone do not control the disease, particularly for preventing fruit and leaf infection.',

        'disease': 'Scab',
        'causes': 'Apple scab is a disease caused by the fungus, Venturia inaequalis, which spreads by airborne spores and survives the winter on fallen leaves. Expect scab marks to appear on leaves from mid-spring until leaf fall in autumn.',
        'treatment': 'Removing blistered twigs and disposing of fallen leaves and infected fruit will help decrease the fungus available to initiate infections in the following growing season. However, this may have limited effectiveness unless the trees are isolated, as the spores can be carried over long distances by the wind.',
