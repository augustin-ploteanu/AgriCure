        'disease': 'Septoria Leaf Spot',
        'causes': 'Septoria leaf spot, caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici, especially in wet, humid conditions. Symptoms typically appear on the lower leaves as circular spots with dark brown margins and tan to gray centers, often leading to yellowing and browning of the leaves.',
        'treatment': 'Remove diseased leaves early, ensuring not to weaken the plant by cutting above fruit. Improve air circulation by staking or caging plants, and apply mulch to reduce soil splash. Avoid overhead watering, control nearby weeds, practice crop rotation, and consider fungicidal sprays if other measures fail, applying them every 7 to 10 days to protect new growth.',

        'disease': 'Early Blight Leaf',
        'causes': 'Early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani, which survives on infected plants or in plant debris.  Early blight symptoms typically begin as plant canopies start to close.  Denser foliage leads to high humidity and longer periods of leaf wetness that favor the disease.',
        'treatment': 'Once early blight symptoms appear, control becomes challenging. Thinning plants or removing affected branches can help by improving airflow and reducing humidity around the leaves. Additionally, applying fungicides containing copper or chlorothalonil early in the progression of the disease and consistently throughout the growing season may provide effective control.',

        'disease': 'Leaf Late Blight',
        'causes': 'Late blight is favored by cool, wet weather, with clouds protecting spores from UV radiation and wet conditions enabling spore infection on leaves. Lesions to appear within 3-5 days, followed by white cottony spore growth. Spores can spread easily by wind, rain, irrigation, and equipment, potentially traveling several miles to infect neighboring fields.',
        'treatment': 'Organic growers have limited chemical options to control late blight, with copper-based fungicides being the most effective. Home gardeners should plant resistant varieties or apply fungicides like copper or chlorothalonil at regular intervals before the disease appears, increasing frequency after detection. Once late blight is present, weekly fungicide sprays are the primary method of protection, but alternating products can help prevent fungicide resistance.',
