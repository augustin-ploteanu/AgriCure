        'disease': 'Black Rot',
        'causes': 'Infected leaves develop reddish-brown circular spots with dark centers, eventually forming black, pimple-like fruiting bodies called pycnidia. Infected berries turn dark brown, covered with pycnidia, and shrivel into hard, black mummies.',
        'treatment': 'Infected prunings and mummified berries should be removed and destroyed before new growth in spring. In vineyards with susceptible varieties or prior black rot issues, early-season fungicide sprays are crucial to prevent initial infections, as controlling fruit rot becomes difficult later in the season. Planting less sensitive grape varieties can also help reduce black rot problems, with early fungicide applications recommended for severe cases.',
